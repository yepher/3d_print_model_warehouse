For adding a cup holder I did not want to screw anything to my side panels or into to the plane. So I designed this part to fit in the existing ashtray.

**Design Notes and Assembly**

I broke this design into two part so it is much easier and faster to print and not require any support material. The part is printed with "pre-drilled" and counter sunk holes to align the part for assembly. The pre-drill is added so the infill can be set really low but you will still get a lot of material around the screw threads (in theory). I added super glue to the joint just for added security but that is probably overkill.
