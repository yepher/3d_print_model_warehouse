This tray holds 12 spark plugs each hole stamped with cylinder number and also marked (T) top and (B) bottom so each plug can be identified easily, no mix-ups. Plugs can be serviced and returned back to where they were removed. This is a must for aircraft mechanics.

Made from 18 gauge steel.
Blue powder coat finish.
Dimensions: W4.0", L8.0", H2.6.
